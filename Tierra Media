Aragorn's Poem 

All that is gold does not glitter;
all that is long does not last;
All that is old does not wither;
not all that is over is past.

Not all that have fallen are vanquished;
a king may yet be without crown,
A blade that was broken be brandished;
and towers that were strong may fall down.

Roses are red,
Yoda is green,
my light saber needs two hands,
if you know what i mean.

Fin
